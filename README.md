# WooEvents
A WooCommerce extension for selling event tickets with QR codes. This plugin introduces a new product type called “Event Ticket” that allows selling tickets with separate prices for adults and children. Tickets are sent as QR codes via email, and prices are calculated dynamically based on the selected number of tickets.

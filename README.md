# WooEvents

WooEvents is a WooCommerce extension for selling event tickets with QR codes. This plugin introduces a new product type called "Event Ticket" that allows selling tickets with separate prices for adults and children. Tickets are sent as QR codes via email, and prices are calculated dynamically based on the selected number of tickets.

## Features

1. **New Product Type**: "Event Ticket" with separate prices for adults and children.
2. **Custom Fields**: Fields for setting adult price, child price, event date, and duration.
3. **Frontend**: Dynamic calculation of the total price based on the number of adult and child tickets.
4. **Cart and Checkout**: Displays the number of adult and child tickets and calculates the price accordingly.
5. **QR Codes**: Generates and sends QR codes for each event ticket order.
6. **Price Display**: Hides the standard price and shows separate prices for adults and children in the product view.
7. **Date Check**: Automatically grays out expired events (these can no longer be purchased/added to the cart).
